by @tylershienlim

## Project Overview


## Technologies & Tools used
- Power BI

## Prerequisites / Installation
1. Download and install Power BI
2. Download datasets
3. Load datasets into Power BI

## Results
- Profitability appeared to be in the red until October 2019
- Both Electronic Games and Tables show a negative profitability trend and warrant attention.
- Roughly 55% of the 332 customers, or 182 in total, have negative profitability.
- The customers with negative profitability are located in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.
- Bookcases and printers emerge as significant influencers in the dataset, playing pivotal roles in overall revenue generation.

## Recommendations 
1. Direct the Branch Manager to assess the least profitable customers.
2. Examine the underperforming States to understand the significant gap in customer profitability.
3. Evaluate suspending sales of Tables and Electronic Games until cost reductions are feasible, as these products are currently detracting from company profitability.
4. Concentrate efforts on expanding the profitable sub-categories to sustain the profitability trend.
